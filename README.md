# dental-appointment

This repository holds the source code for my Honours Project at Carleton University,
under the supervision of Professor Jean-Pierre Corriveau.

This project consists of a client and a server. The client code is under the `frontend`
directory, and the server code is under the `backend` directory. The client is written in
JavaScript with React, and the server is written in Python with Django.

## Run server

TODO

## Run client

To build and run the client for development, run `npm install` to install all dependencies,
and then run `npm start` to start the client. The webapp can then be accessed at
http://localhost:3000.

To build the client for "production", run `npm install` to install all dependencies,
and then run `npm run build` to build a hardened client.
