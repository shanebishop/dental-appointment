docker-compose up -d --build fails because of npm install on frontend.
I tried several things, but my current thought is that it is due to
poor internet connectivity on the Island.

I have concluded this, because in ~/src/stackoverflow-questions, I
ran the same docker-compose up -d --build command twice in a row without
changing any code. Once I got a socket timeout error after pulling
several modules, and the second time it failed, talking about config.

First:

Step 6/6 : RUN npm install

Second, with no code changes between running:

My plan is to try again when I'm back in the soo.

Next step is to create an Administration page group in the sidebar, where
one of the pages in the group is Register Client so a new client can be
registered by a staff member.
